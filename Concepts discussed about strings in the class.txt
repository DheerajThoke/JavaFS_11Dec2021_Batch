Things we discussed about the String -

The preceding discussion of data types has no mention of strings or a string data type. This is not 
because Java does not support such a type—it does. It is just that Java’s string type, called String,
is not a simple type. Nor is it simply an array of characters. Rather, String defines an object, and 
a full description of it requires an understanding of several object-related features. 

The String type is used to declare string variables. You can also declare arrays of strings.
Aquoted string constant can be assigned to a String variable. A variable of type String can
be assigned to another variable of type String. You can use an object of type String as an
argument to println( ). 

For example, consider the following fragment:
String str = "this is a test";
System.out.println(str);
Here, str is an object of type String. It is assigned the string “this is a test”. This string is
displayed by the println( ) statement.
